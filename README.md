# Ping-Pong-game-Python-

I used pygame library to make this game. SCREEN , CLOCK , players and ball are implemented by pygame . I use while loop to make the ball moving with a particular velocity in the screen . I inputted dircections for player using pygame key class . direction of ball change when coordinates of ball and player becomes equal (i.e they collide). The opponent moves upward if ball's y-coordinate is higher than opponent and opponent moves downward if ball's y-coordinate is lower than opponent .
